# Deployment and CI

## Project workflow

```sh
export XAPI_API_HOST=api.test.xapi.to
xapi workers templates
xapi workers init my-service --template persistent-agent
cd my-service
xapi workers plan --env preview
```

For an APAC-oriented service, initialize or edit the environment desired state
with `defaultResourceLocation: "apac"` and `placementMode: "smart"`. The first
setting applies only when xAPI creates new D1/R2 resources; the second emits
Cloudflare's native Smart Placement metadata on Worker deployment. Workers
remain global, and neither setting moves existing stored data.

Choose the API host explicitly: `api.test.xapi.to` operates test-platform
resources; `api.xapi.to` operates production-platform resources. `--env preview`
selects a project's preview environment on that host, not the test API. A
production acceptance deployment can therefore use `api.xapi.to` with
`--env preview`. Do not silently fall back to a saved test key or host.

For an existing project use `xapi workers init --from-wrangler ./wrangler.jsonc` (TOML also supported). Generated framework configs may live below the project root, for example `dist/server/wrangler.json`; run the command from the package directory so xAPI writes `xapi.worker.json` beside `package.json` and resolves generated asset paths back to that root. Read its import report; do not auto-accept unsupported settings. xAPI creates environment-specific resources; do not copy another Cloudflare account's IDs.

`xapi.worker.json` holds desired xAPI state and Worker ID; Wrangler holds entrypoint, compatibility and binding declarations. The persistent-agent template declares all six managed resource types so it can demonstrate the complete platform, but an ordinary application should declare only the resources its business logic uses. Do not add unrelated bindings merely to complete an acceptance checklist. Test the full resource matrix in a separate disposable Worker or environment, then clean up only that isolated test state. Install/build according to the generated project instructions. Inspect plans for missing permissions, prices, secrets, budget, and policy requirements.

```sh
xapi workers push --env preview
xapi workers get <worker-id> --format json
xapi workers secrets set <worker-id> APP_TOKEN --env preview --from-env APP_TOKEN
xapi workers logs <worker-id> --env preview --since 10m
```

If provisioning requires an accepted retention quote, follow lifecycle.md and pass its exact `--retention-price-version VERSION`; do not invent a version. Supply secrets when the Worker exists and rerun the unchanged project command if a missing secret blocked deployment. Never report a blocked preflight as successful deployment.

Use the Node and package-manager version required by the application before `plan` or `push`; the CLI runs the configured build command unchanged. If the project declares `engines.node`, activate a compatible runtime first. A build-runtime failure is an application build failure and must occur before any deployment write; rerun the same push only after correcting the local runtime.

For SSR frameworks that generate a complete Wrangler bundle, preserve that native bundle rather than uploading source files one at a time. For vinext/Next.js, a typical build command is:

```sh
npm run build
npx wrangler deploy --dry-run \
  --config dist/server/wrangler.json \
  --outfile dist/app.worker.bundle
```

Set `build.output` to the generated `.worker.bundle`, omit `build.main`, and set `assets.directory` to the generated client directory. `--dry-run` only creates the local Cloudflare upload artifact; `xapi workers push` remains the only publisher. The CLI sends the complete modules/assets set in one authenticated multipart Artifact request. The import report must show every unmapped Wrangler field; never split a framework application into per-file API uploads to work around an import problem.

Use the environment's returned `publicUrl` for actual requests. A custom-domain URL needs verified DNS/TLS readiness; do not construct a hostname or infer readiness from the organization name. Use application authentication, never the control-plane key, on this URL.

The dispatcher reserves and strips incoming `x-xapi-*` headers. Use an
application-owned header such as `x-my-app-token`, or normal application
authentication, for your own probes and APIs. Do not disable this filtering to
make a probe pass. Also inspect returned state: `domains retry` can return a
domain record with `status: ERROR`; command completion does not certify DNS,
TLS, root-relative assets or OAuth callback readiness.

After deployment reaches ACTIVE, run health plus business persistence and asynchronous completion checks in resources.md. Review data/schema compatibility before promoting the same preview artifact:

```sh
xapi workers promote --to production
xapi workers rollback --env production --to previous
# Or an explicit deployment visible in the selected environment:
xapi workers rollback --env production --deployment <deployment-id>
```

Rollback restores code and compatibility settings, not data, schema, Secret values, schedules, or Queue/Workflow state. Preview and production each have their own current deployment; an old deployment reference is not proof an environment is still serving.

## CI runner

Use the project's installed/pinned CLI, lockfile installation, and a scoped secret `XAPI_KEY`. Keep `XAPI_API_HOST` explicit and separate test/production credentials. CLI deployment does not require SSH into an API server or a Cloudflare account token.

Run plan, build/push, active-status and business checks in order. `--non-interactive` suppresses prompts; it does not accept retention policy or bypass preflight:

```sh
xapi workers plan --env preview --format json
xapi workers push --env preview --non-interactive
```

Promote in the already authorized release job after preview acceptance. Follow repository AGENTS.md and branch/PR rules; do not infer release authorization from a successful preview push. On uncertain results inspect deployments/logs and retry unchanged inputs so stable idempotency keys can recover the same operation. Do not change IDs or clear deletion flags to force deployment through.

A `worker_control_*` conflict is a server rollout or environment-enrollment failure, not a hint to bypass xAPI with Wrangler. Preserve the existing deployment and resources, record the exact error code, inspect `workers audit`, and have the platform operator restore a compatible control-plane configuration before retrying the unchanged deployment.

For explicit artifact operations: `workers upload <worker-id> --file dist/worker.mjs --idempotency-key <stable-key>`, then `workers deploy <worker-id> --artifact <artifact-id> --env preview --idempotency-key <stable-release-key>`. Reuse a key only for identical inputs. `workers build` is an optional managed Sandbox build, not a requirement for deploying locally built code.
